Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. Using the command git init to initialize a repository will create an empty 
repo within your working directory. We can use git add to add files to the 
staging area before commiting those files to our new repo. We need to do this inorder to store meta data about the history of the repo in hidden .git files.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers? 

The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the 
repo which gives me more control over which files get bundled together into a 
single commit into the repo. The rule of thumb is one commit per logical change
so it makes sense for me to bundle related files into different commit groups.
